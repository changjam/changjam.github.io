Fried Rice Recipe
Ingredients:
2 cups of cooked white rice (preferably leftover rice)
3 eggs
1 spring onion
1/2 cup of green peas (optional)
1/2 cup of diced carrots (optional)
2 tablespoons of scallion oil or other cooking oil
2 tablespoons of soy sauce
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
Steps:
Prepare the ingredients. Fluff up the leftover white rice, chop the spring onion into small pieces, dice the carrots, prepare the green peas, and beat the eggs.

Scramble the eggs. Heat one tablespoon of cooking oil in a frying pan, pour in the beaten eggs, and stir with chopsticks or a spoon to create scrambled eggs. Cook until just set, then remove and set aside.

Fry the rice. In the same frying pan, heat another tablespoon of cooking oil, add the spring onion and diced carrots, and saut√© for about 1 minute until fragrant. Then add the white rice, break it apart with a spatula, and fry until heated through.

Season. Drizzle soy sauce over the fried rice, add salt and pepper to taste, and continue to stir-fry until well combined.

Add the ingredients. Pour the scrambled eggs and green peas into the fried rice, gently mix until the ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the rice.

Serve. Transfer the fried rice to a serving dish, garnish with some chopped spring onions if desired, and it's ready to enjoy.

Tips:

For a richer flavor, you can add a small amount of fish sauce or mirin while frying the rice.
Feel free to add other vegetables or meats according to personal preference, such as diced ham or green bell peppers.
