# Fried Rice Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 2 cups of cooked white rice (preferably leftover rice)
- 3 eggs
- 1 spring onion
- 1/2 cup of green peas (optional)
- 1/2 cup of diced carrots (optional)
- 2 tablespoons of scallion oil or other cooking oil
- 2 tablespoons of soy sauce
- Salt to taste
- Pepper to taste

## Steps:
1. **Prepare the ingredients.** Fluff up the leftover white rice, chop the spring onion into small pieces, dice the carrots, prepare the green peas, and beat the eggs.

2. **Scramble the eggs.** Heat one tablespoon of cooking oil in a frying pan, pour in the beaten eggs, and stir with chopsticks or a spoon to create scrambled eggs. Cook until just set, then remove and set aside.

3. **Fry the rice.** In the same frying pan, heat another tablespoon of cooking oil, add the spring onion and diced carrots, and saut√© for about 1 minute until fragrant. Then add the white rice, break it apart with a spatula, and fry until heated through.

4. **Season.** Drizzle soy sauce over the fried rice, add salt and pepper to taste, and continue to stir-fry until well combined.

5. **Add the ingredients.** Pour the scrambled eggs and green peas into the fried rice, gently mix until the ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the rice.

6. **Serve.** Transfer the fried rice to a serving dish, garnish with some chopped spring onions if desired, and it's ready to enjoy.

## Tips:
- For a richer flavor, you can add a small amount of fish sauce or mirin while frying the rice.
- Feel free to add other vegetables or meats according to personal preference, such as diced ham or green bell peppers.
